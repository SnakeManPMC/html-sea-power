2024-10-12T13:00:00Z Ultrawide [monitor] Support? <i>All good. Yes we will support ultrawide. Here's an example: <a href="screenshots/Sea-Power-Ultrawide-Monitor-2024-10-12.jpg" target="_blank">Sea-Power-Ultrawide-Monitor-2024-10-12.jpg</a> Not sure there is anything more than 32:9 out there?</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4701286545158348067/#c4701286545158783678" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-10-07T06:33:00Z Multi monitor support? <i>Yes that has been asked before and yes we're working on multi monitor support. :) Currently not the highest prio on our list but we plan to add it.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852156627900104161/#c4852156627901764185" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-10-07T06:29:00Z Night mission red light on tactical map view? <i>Yes, we're considering that. It's on our list but has not the highest prio. Thank you!</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852156627899875480/#c4852156627901752820" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-10-02T06:58:00Z Question about game performance? <i>Yes that should work. Our game is mainly CPU bound which means the CPU is the bottle neck as we have quite some sophisticated sensor modelling in.</i>, question: Are you going to use 64bit mutithreading? answer: <i>Yes we're making heavy use of threading.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852156144180727528/#c4852156627901756529" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-10-02T07:11:00Z Biologics? Will they be in game? <i>We're currently working on them, so they should be in.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852156227488110658/#c4852156227488397536" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-10-01T07:02:00Z Bad weather, high waves? <i>We have that modelled that the visual range is lower then as well as some sensors will have worse results. E.g. the ambient noise is much higher which affects sonar.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852155593259062894/#c4852156144180549585" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-09-30T21:23:00Z <i>Honestly we plan to work in this game for probably years to come and add content to it.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4854407119828918007/#c4852155975767028204" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-09-28T21:03:00Z <i>Yes we have some cinematic camera tools in and more will come. Our current tools allow smooth rotation around up axis, up/down rotation, moving towards/away from/to a target, sine rotation around a target. You can also move the camera to a specific point while following a target (e.g. fix it to a wing of an aircraft) and you can set your own point of view for a flyby perspective - which was used in the trailer for instance where that Soviet aircraft launced from an airfield.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852155797910200985/#c4852155797910218770" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-09-28T21:26:00Z <i>We're currently implementing Workshop support. It's not 100% clear if it will make it into the initial release but the idea is to use Steam Workshop as a first test bed for scenarios. What's already working is mission sharing by sending someone just the mission file. It's basically an ini file, so a text file which you put into a folder within the game and that's it. It will then show up in the list of available missions. There are more complex possibilities (e.g. adding images and such) but we want to provide some templates later on as well to support modding. As I said the goal is to have the Steam Workshop in. First for scenarios, later for almost everything.</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4852155797908526318/#c4852155797908744350" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.

2024-09-22T06:39:00Z <i>Yes weather influences the sensor capabilities. There is the typical conditions like clear, broken, scattered, overcast for clouds as well as storm, rain, snow, lightnings, etc...</i> -source <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1286220/discussions/0/4854407119826570969/#c4854407119827693879" target="_blank">Triassic Games [developer] post</a>.
