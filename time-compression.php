	<h1>Time Compression Sea Power</h1>
<p>Welcome to PMC website for naval warfare game: Sea Power Naval Combat in the Missile Age.</p>

	<h2>Time Compression Sea Power</h2>

<p>
Sea Power runs in real time or compressed time according to what player sets the time. Highest time acceleration or time compression is ONE HUNDRED TIMES speed, ie x100 of real time.
</p>

<p>
You can see current time mode/speed from top right corner in the GUI, shown below. This example image is from ten times speed (x10).

<p>
I don't have the full list of available time compression speeds, obviously first is x1 speed ie real time, one hour in-game is one hour of your playing this game. There are other confirmed time compression speeds of: x3 and x10. PMCTODO
</p>

<p>
As with always when using time compression, be very careful when your units are operating in the sea and in the skies, if there are bad guys around you might be in a knife fight before you know it if you just rock'n'roll with high time compression ratio.
