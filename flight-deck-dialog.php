<p>
Flight Deck dialog is for launching and recovering aircrafts/helicopters from various platforms, aribases and ships.
</p>

<p>
In the above example image we have aircraft capacity 1/1 meaning we only have one single aircraft. Type is SH-2F which is US Navy Sea Sprite helicopter. Loadout is Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW). Assigned drop down shows 1 as in this example there is only single aircraft available, if you'd have more then you could assign the number of airframes using that drop down. The big launch button simply launches whatever you've got selected. Flight operations box has the status of currently operating aircrafts/helicopters, are they taking off, landing, etc.
