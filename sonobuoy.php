	<h2>Sonobuoy Sea Power</h2>

<p>
<i>A sonobuoy (a portmanteau of sonar and buoy) is a small expendable sonar buoy dropped from aircraft or ships for anti-submarine warfare or underwater acoustic research. Sonobuoys are typically around 13 cm (5 in) in diameter and 91 cm (3 ft) long. When floating on the water, sonobuoys have both a radio transmitter above the surface and hydrophone sensors underwater.</i> -source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobuoy" target="_blank">Sonobuoy wikipedia</a>.

Select a helicopter with ASW loadout, sonobuoys, then use CTRL-RMB click with sonobuoys to create a search pattern waypoints. See below example image.

In several Sea Power youtube videos I've seen players drop sonobuoys just to detect and track SURFACE ships as well if they don't want to use surface search radars, to me personally I never witnessed this in any other naval warfare sim previously, Harpoon, Janes Fleet Command, Dangerous Water, Cold Waters or CMANO, but hey maybe its just me.

Another example image for sonobuoy search pattern, this time created with "SHIFT-CLICK", I don't know what click means, is it LMB or RMB, will have to get the game on release day to find out for myself. I'm assuming that CTRL-RMB clicking will automatically generate systematic search pattern as seen in the above image, but SHIFT-LEFT-OR-RIGHT-MOUSE clicking enables you to manually place waypoints for sonobuoy drops. In "SEA POWER Kirov Supremacy" video Wolfpack345 confirmed that there is automatic search pattern which I assume he refers to CTRL-RMB click. PMCTODO

Guess that is sonobuoy helicopter search pattern manual waypoints method then. Looks good, love making my own search patterns to hunt those submarines down.
