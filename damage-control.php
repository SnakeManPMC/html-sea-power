<p>
When your units like ships get hit, check damage control screen for well, the damage caused. You can access it by RMB clicking unit icon on <a href="tactical-display.php">Tactical Display</a> and choosing "Damage Control" option. Then a dialog pops up like in the below example image.

<p>
Here the example ship has heavy hull damage and slight flooding. "DC Teams" mean damage control teams, apparently in this example image they are in "Auto" mode, however it says 0/2 so I do not know what that means, are all the damage control team personnel dead from the attack (you see the ship burning in the background). I don't know as I'm writing this all based on Wolfpack345's video currently. PMCTODO

<p>
You can assign damage control teams to work on specific parts of the ship, or keep them in "Auto" mode where AI controls what will be repaired first.

Below image example if from USS Nimitz after it got hit by several soviet anti ship missiles.
